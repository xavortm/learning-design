This is focused on web design, illustrations, color theory and so on. It's made by **Alex Dimitrov** - web designer, front-end developer and hobbyst in many areas, so the focus of this list is also bound around the web.

### What is this?

A list of tutorials in order of which and when to study. If you want to contribute with resources open a new issue linking what and where should be put or edited. Every time you encounter something new bookmark it. Later when you're ready with the articles feel free to research more on it. Try to put everything learned in practise to speed up the learning process.
